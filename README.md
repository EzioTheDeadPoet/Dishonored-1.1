# Dishonored Plus

A **VERY** small Dishonored modlist.

## Description

This is a list that just brings some little quality of life features into Dishonored, the mid mission stats page and detection and kill notices, that are by default available in Dishonored 2, the startup movie skip and the despawning bodies fix. This is why I called this list Dishonored Plus there simply isn't much besides these quality of life changes you can do with this great game that is Dishonored.
Also I have included my personal ReShade preset, since I thought it did fit well with the game.

I would potentially have included more, but can't because there isn't really more.
The only other mods there are, I would consider cheat mods.

## Installation

- get the .wabbajack file of the list.
- use the install local modlist to install it.
- go to the install directory and copy the contents of the `Game Folder Files` folder into your games base folder. In most cases it should be called `Dishonored`.
- run the game and enjoy.
